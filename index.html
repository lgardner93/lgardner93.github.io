	<br> 
	BSc (Hons) Game Technology: Second Class Degree, Upper Division
	<br> 
	<br>
	A 3 year university course largely based around programming (C#/C++/Python) and game design, 
	with a small focus on web development (HTML/CSS). The time at university was also used to further 
	develop time keeping skills, financial management and work prioritisation.

	<br>
	Other modules included Artificial Intelligence, Systems Development, 3D Environments, 
	Ethics, and Post Production. My final year individual project was based around procedural generation 
	through code, with a particular focus on procedural village generation.

		<p> Kingsley Consulting is a website that was in development for a client looking to 
		start their own consultancy firm. The client's vision for the website was to have a website which provided the necessary information
		with a clean, minimalistic design. A logo was also designed for the site with Adobe Photoshop. Development on the website has been 
		postponed until further notice.</p>
